Description: In a ZFC-like environment augmented by reference to the
ambient type theory, we develop some basic set theory, ordinals, cardinals
and transfinite induction, and category theory including functors,
natural transformations, limits and colimits, functor categories,
and the theorem that functor_cat a b has (co)limits if b does.
Keywords: set ordinal cardinal category functor natural
transformation limit colimit functor category
